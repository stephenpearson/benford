# Demonstration of Benford's Law In Python

A simple piece of code to show that cumulative growth functions such as
multiplying, squaring, addition etc does not produce a random distribution
of digits even when supplied with a totally random input set.

To run the code:
```
./benford/main.py
```

Outputs a chart showing the relative probability of digits in the result set.
